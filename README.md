A widget for displaying feeds from Elsevier Pure in WordPress.

# Description

This widget offers publications from [Elsevier Pure](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/pure) feeds.

This widget offers a cleaned experience for [Elsevier Pure](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/pure) feeds, compared to the RSS feeds. The primary intented use scenario is to list newest publications in a widget on a webpage of a research group or lab or other organizational unit.

Developed primarily for the [MAD Art and Design research group](https://pure.itu.dk/portal/en/organisations/mad-art--design(cf9b4e6a-e1ad-41e3-9475-7679abe7131b).html) at [IT University of Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk).

Pure RSS feeds are a bit of a mess, therefore this plugin might be necessary. Basically. Instead of RSS, this lifts data from the Pure API, and renders it as HTML for human consumption.

# Installation

Install as usual for WordPress plugins.

# Configuration

After installing and enabling as usual for WordPress plugins, PURE API URL is needed, together with API key which you can acquire from the Pure administrator. Additionally organisation ID is needed to filter publications. You can find there on the Pure website, e.g. the Pure page of MAD Art & Design at IT University of Copenhagen is https://pure.itu.dk/portal/en/organisations/mad-art--design(cf9b4e6a-e1ad-41e3-9475-7679abe7131b).html, and the organisation ID is 'cf9b4e6a-e1ad-41e3-9475-7679abe7131b'. Enter these in the widget configuration, and select a bibliographical style, typically perhaps APA or Vancouver.
