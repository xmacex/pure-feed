After installing and enabling as usual for WordPress plugins, PURE API URL is needed, together with API key which you can acquire from the Pure administrator. Additionally organisation ID is needed to filter publications. You can find there on the Pure website, e.g. the Pure page of MAD Art & Design at IT University of Copenhagen is https://pure.itu.dk/portal/en/organisations/mad-art--design(cf9b4e6a-e1ad-41e3-9475-7679abe7131b).html, and the organisation ID is 'cf9b4e6a-e1ad-41e3-9475-7679abe7131b'. Enter these in the widget configuration, and select a bibliographical style, typically perhaps APA or Vancouver.
