A widget for displaying feeds from Elsevier Pure in WordPress.

# Description

This widget offers publications from [Elsevier Pure](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/pure) feeds. Developed primarily for the [MAD Art and Design research group](https://pure.itu.dk/portal/en/organisations/mad-art--design(cf9b4e6a-e1ad-41e3-9475-7679abe7131b).html) at [IT University of Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk).

Pure RSS feeds are a bit of a mess, therefore this plugin might be necessary. Basically. Instead of RSS, this lifts data from the Pure API, and renders it as HTML for human consumption.

# Installation

The usual WordPress thing.

# Configuration

See the usual WordPress administration panel.

# Feedback is welcome

Please create issues and pull requests, or if you are at ITU, come have a chat.
